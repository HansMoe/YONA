## Introduction

In real-world applications of machine learning, reliable and safe systems must consider
measures of performance beyond standard test set accuracy. These other goals
include out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, prediction consistency, resilience to
adversaries, calibrated uncertainty estimates, and the ability to detect anomalous
inputs. However, improving performance towards these goals is often a balancing
act that todayâ€™s methods cannot achieve without sacrificing performance on other
safety axes, raising the question of whether a Pareto improvement on
all existing safety measures is possible. To meet this challenge, we design a new
data augmentation strategy utilizing the natural structural complexity of pictures
such as fractals, which outperforms numerous baselines, is near Pareto-optimal,
and comprehensively improves safety measures.

## Contents

`pixmix_utils.py` includes reference implementation of augmentations and mixings used in PixMix.

We also include PyTorch implementations of PixMix on both CIFAR-10/100 and
ImageNet in `cifar.py` and `imagenet.py` respectively, which both support
training and evaluation on CIFAR-10/100-C and ImageNet-C/R.

## Usage

Training recipes used in our paper:

CIFAR: 
  ```
  python cifar.py \
    --dataset <cifar10 or cifar100> \
    --data-path <path/to/cifar and cifar-c> \
    --mixing-set <path/to/mixing_set> \
    --all-ops
  ```

ImageNet 1K:
  ```
  python imagenet.py \
    --data-standard <path/to/imagenet_train> \
    --data-val <path/to/imagenet_val> \
    --imagenet-r-dir <path/to/imagenet_r> \
    --imagenet-c-dir <path/to/imagenet_c> \
    --mixing-set <path/to/mixing_set> \
    --num-classes 1000 \
    --all-ops
  ```
